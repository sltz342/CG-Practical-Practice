We chose to use Toon/Cel Shading for the player model to differentiate the player and the fighter from the boxing ring and bring focus to him via a different lighting style, forcing the user to recognize him from the background/ring.

We used Specular Lighting for the Boxing Ring floor to create a metallic look with normal mapping, in order to create a reflective look that fits more with the material style, and amplifies the details of the background. The shiny floor gives a more realistic effect of an arena with lights focused on the fight.

We finally used ambient lighting on the four poles of the boxing ring to emulate the slightly metallic/solid look of the poles and to contrast the toon shader and the ring floor to give a satisfying visual effect.
